# 1) What does CUBE do in sql query?
## tags: cube, sql, query

In SQL, the CUBE operator is used to generate a result set that includes subtotals for all possible combinations of specified columns in a SELECT statement. It produces a cross-tabulation of the data that summarizes the information along multiple dimensions.

The CUBE operator generates a result set that includes subtotals for all possible combinations of the columns listed in the GROUP BY clause. For example, if the GROUP BY clause includes three columns, the CUBE operator generates subtotals for each of the columns, for each pair of columns, for each combination of two columns and for the combination of all three columns.

The syntax for using CUBE in a SQL query is as follows:
  
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, column3, aggregate_function(column)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY CUBE (column1, column2, column3);
```
In this query, the GROUP BY clause specifies the columns to group the data by, and the CUBE operator is used to generate subtotals for all possible combinations of these columns. The aggregate function is used to perform calculations on the data, such as SUM or COUNT.

The result set generated by the CUBE operator can be very large, especially if the number of columns listed in the GROUP BY clause is large. However, it can be useful in analyzing data along multiple dimensions and identifying trends or patterns that might not be apparent from a simple summary of the data.
